\label{sec:nix-light-grammar}

The grammar of nix-light is based of the grammar of nix and brings several
modifications:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The main difference concerns records, whose representation is simplified as
    much as possible:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Litteral records are always atomic (\emph{ie} only have one field). An
        \emph{orthogonal merge} operator ($\orthplus$) allows building complex
        records~\footnote{We still often write \{ $s_1$ = $y_1$; $\cdots{}$;
        $s_n$ = $y_n$ \} as a shorthand for \{ $s_1$ = $y_1$; \} $\orthplus
        \cdots{} \orthplus$ \{ $s_n$ = $y_n$; \}},

      \item The syntax in nix for a recursive definition of records (\texttt{\{ x.y
        = 1; x.z = 2; \}}) doesn't exist anymore,

      \item The labels can only be nix expressions (so litteral labels must be
        written as constant strings).
    \end{itemize}

  \item Another huge change is the removal of the \emph{if} construct which is
    replaced by a more general \emph{typecase} which is easier to reason on.

  \item The third notable change is that the opaque list construct of nix is
    replaced by the classical \texttt{nil} and \texttt{cons}.
    This avoids having over-complicated typing and evaluation rules for lists.

    For consistency, a pattern for lists has also been added.
\end{itemize}

The grammar of nix-light is given in the
figures~\pref{grammar::expressions},~\pref{grammar::values}
and~\pref{grammar::types}.
